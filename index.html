    <h2>Home of Great-tailed Grackle facts and musings.</h2>
    <p>I've lived in Austin for several years. Despite many complaints amongst the local community I've fallen in love with
        the <em>Quiscalus mexicanus.</em> They're majestic and they don't give a damn about your opinion.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>They will eat anything</li>
        <li>They terrify locals</li>
        <li>They stole their vocalizations from a <a href="http://yourshot.nationalgeographic.com/photos/8113694/" target=".unknown"><strong> sea turtle.</strong></a></li>

    </ul>

    <p>Immediate goals for this website are to add frustratingly loud grackle calls alongside random flying grackle images throughout
        the webpage. And some COLOR BABY!!!</p>
